an ELE's childhood shenanigans. Uses servos for all functions. 4 servos in total: 1 opens/closes the claw, 1 raises/lowers the claw, 2 control the gantry. Claw I made out of scrapwood and a slice of a copper pipe. gantry was made with some linear rods (i think meant for a cnc machine). Two servos control a band that attaches to the slider holding the claw which gives it 360 degrees of motion. Don't yell at me for the legs, I'll put something better on there eventually. Here's the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1obrRc9rNsD04WiVDTe_Kekj-50wOGUwN/view
